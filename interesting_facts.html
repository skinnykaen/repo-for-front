                    Belarus is located in Eastern Europe and, due to its position, is a buffer between Western Europe and Russia. According to some reports,
                    it is in our country that the geographical center of Europe is located - 50 kilometers from Polotsk (Lake Sho).

                    The area of ​​Belarus is 207 thousand square kilometers. Belgium, Switzerland and Greece could fit entirely on its territory.
                    By the way, Belarus is the largest country in Europe that has no access to the sea.

                    Belarus is one of the ten most wooded countries in Europe - forests occupy 38.8% of its territory. 
                    But at the same time, our country is one of the few countries in Europe where 
                    there is no sea or real mountains. The highest point in Belarus - Dzerzhinskaya Gora - has a height of only 345 meters, and 
                    the largest reservoir is Lake Naroch with an area of ​​79.62 square kilometers.
                    Belarus is also called "the lungs of Europe" - about 30% of the country's territory is occupied by swampy lands.

                    The most common language in Belarus is Russian. About 80% of the population speaks it at home. However, the names of settlements are 
                    often written only in Belarusian, as are the names of streets. Announcements in public transport are also heard in Belarusian.
                    About 4% of the population of Belarus speaks English.

                    About a quarter of the territory was polluted, the most fertile lands were damaged, and two million inhabitants had to be relocated. 
                    Today, the Polesie radiation-ecological reserve has been created in the contaminated areas.

                    Msqrd application and many others were created here? The Belarusian Hi-Tech Park is sometimes called
